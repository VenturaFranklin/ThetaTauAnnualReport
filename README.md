# ThetaTauAnnualReport (Legacy Information)
The annual report google scripts for Theta Tau, the professional engineering fraternity

# Contributing
Google scripts does not seem to have a very good method of collaboration, or I haven't figured it out.<br>
If you know of a better way, please let me know.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a copy of the master sheet.<br>
  (Email me for a copy, frank.ventura@thetatau.org)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making a copy, you should automatically have the code, ThetaTauReportsBOUND, in the script editor.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code in the script editor will be exactly what is on the master branch on github.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, style changes (eg. adding a row/column to the sheet) I do not have a good way of incorporating those changes back.)
3. Find a task to work on at Github <br>
  https://github.com/VenturaFranklin/ThetaTauAnnualReport/issues<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure to claim the task
4. Make a new branch for your work.
5. Commit and push your work to your branch.
6. Submit a pull request.
