# ThetaTauAnnualReport
The annual report google scripts for Theta Tau, the professional engineering fraternity

# Contributing
Google scripts does not seem to have a very good method of collaboration, or I haven't figured it out.<br>
If you know of a better way, please let me know.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a copy of the master sheet.
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10avD_q_RiDwUDuJ8Nw36vWixeJzmPATjW73DnnHRNJo/edit?usp=sharing
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making a copy, you should automatically have the code, ThetaTauReportsBOUND, in the script editor.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code in the script editor will be exactly what is on the master branch on github.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, style changes (eg. adding a row/column to the sheet) I do not have a good way of incorporating those changes back.)
3. Find a task to work on at Trello <br>

4. Make a new branch for your work.
5. Commit and push your work to your branch.
6. Submit a pull request.
